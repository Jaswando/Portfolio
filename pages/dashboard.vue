			<paragraph header="Overview" text="Developing a large number of app, web and software based products InCrowd saw the value in creating an avenue to visually report data driven insights to clients to inform on performance, usage, demographic etc. While also providing insights internally to record crash rates, bounce rates etc to inform product design decisions and QA test. The vision was to see one system in place to handle tiers of users who will only see the sets of data assigned to their role."/>
			<paragraph header="Research stage" text="I began by interviewing stakeholders to understand what the business goals were and how that aligns with the user needs. To help keep everyone on the same page this started out as a few sketches and wireframes to help communicate a shared vision at this stage. To pitch and present the concept these sketches quickly became high fidelity mockups to help pitch and share the idea with the wider team."/>
