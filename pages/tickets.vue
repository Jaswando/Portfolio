I was working with project managers & developers on what would be our first step in to the ticketing world to deliver a focused MVP which would revolutionize how fans manage their tickets and improve the stadium attendance and experience."/>

            <ul class="list-reset mb-12">
				<li>- Understand the existing fan process of purchasing or receiving a ticket, then using it for access.</li>
				<li>- Understanding the technical limitations regarding the account tickets are purchased under and how that is then displayed in app.</li>

            <paragraph header="User needs" text="To get this off of the ground we decided to work exclusively with Birmingham City FC. This allowed us to work closely with a trial group of fans that we could test & validate designs, while also providing the ability to schedule real life test days. To start we conducted User interviews and meetings with Birmingham City this helped us establish initial processes and frictions with the existing system."/>
            <paragraph header="User Flow" text="I setup a workshop with our developers to run through the API details we received. This would help inform the user flows so we can compromise on an effective user experience while retaining best performance."/>

			<paragraph header="Wireframing" text="The process involved to link an account was starting to appear convoluted and with the additional edge cases to consider it was key that we nailed how the process was presented. I to started rapidly wireframe and test solutions to make this process as effortless as possible."/>
